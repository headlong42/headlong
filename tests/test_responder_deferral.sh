# tests/test_responder_deferral.sh — deferrals that bind the mind
# (design/conversation_memory.md, part 5).
#
# Usage: tests/test_responder_deferral.sh
#
# The responder has no tools. When the model answers "DEFER: <work>" on the
# first line, the step must send the holding message below it, append an
# `action` step (source responder, trigger_step, person, request) that the
# monolith routes on, and mark its observation deferred. The monolith step
# must then show a PENDING REQUEST routing hint naming the exact follow-up
# command until an observation carries resolves=<trigger>. `chat reply
# --follow-up` must deliver a second reply to an already answered message,
# which the duplicate guard otherwise refuses. Stubbed llm and shellm; no LLM
# calls, no docker.

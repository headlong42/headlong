# tests/test_recent_stream_filter.sh — the recent-stream filter thinkers read
# (design/conversation_memory.md, part 3; Experiment B).
#
# Usage: tests/test_recent_stream_filter.sh
#
# Builds a trajectory by hand and calls _recent_stream from thinkers/_lib.
# Pins: reasoning steps are dropped, final steps kept, runs of consecutive idle
# (and error) steps collapse into one line with a count and duration, idles
# separated by another step are not merged, order is preserved, content is
# still truncated at 1500 characters, and the window (N) counts lines after
# collapsing. No LLM calls, no docker.
